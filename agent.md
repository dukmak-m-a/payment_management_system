# agent.md — Payment / Compliance Document Tracking Engine — Technical Reference

## Role of this file

This is the **what**: exact DB schema, API endpoints, and known
implementation gotchas for the current codebase. It's written to be generic
and reusable across deployments — the only client-specific values live in
"Branding & Design" below, clearly marked as placeholders.

- For the business narrative and architectural decisions behind the current
  deployment (NGO/donor compliance tracking), see `project-context.md`.
- For how Claude Code should behave while working in this repo, see
  `CLAUDE.md`.

Don't duplicate content across these three files — if something changes,
update it in the one file whose job it is, not all three.

## Database Schema (Supabase / PostgreSQL)

> Verified directly against a live Supabase schema export (not reconstructed
> from application code). **Updated 2026-07-19 after the Status-merge migration
> landed:** `Fatura` (Invoices), `Makbuz` (Receipts), `Payments.ReceiptCode`,
> and `Suppliers.TaxId` have all been **dropped**; `RequiresTranslation`
> (boolean, default `true`) and `AssignedTo` (text) were **added** to Invoices
> and Receipts. The DDL below reflects the post-migration schema. (Gotchas #7
> and #8 are now resolved — kept below for history.)

## Requirements tables + compliance views (Phase 4)

Built in `sql/phase4_requirements.sql` (run separately; not part of the DDL above).

- **`PaymentRequirements`** (payment-grain human slots): `PaymentId` → `Payments.id`
  (ON DELETE CASCADE), `DocType` ∈ {Dekont, TransferOrder, OdemeEmri}, `Status`
  four-state (Missing/Unnecessary/Requested/Collected, DEFAULT `Missing`),
  `UNIQUE(PaymentId, DocType)`.
- **`ProjectRequirements`** (project-grain human slots): `ProjectId` → `Projects.id`,
  `DocType` ∈ {Contract, Karar, TeslimBelgesi, AlindiBelgesi, Fotograflar}, same Status.
- **Views** (read-only, computed live — never stored): `receipt_compliance`
  (payment-grain), `invoice_compliance` (project-grain amount-coverage),
  `compliance_report` (wide, one row per payment, mirrors the legacy sheet; also exposes
  `payment_id`/`project_id` for the edit path). The 4 computed slots
  (invoice/fatura/receipt/makbuz) come only from the views, never from a table.

## Key Relationships & FK Notes

- `Projects.SupplierId` → `Suppliers.id` (required)
- `Projects` has **no** `DonorId` — do not add donor joins to Projects queries
- `Payments.ProjectId` → `Projects.id` (required, numeric id)
- `Payments.SupplierId` → `Suppliers.id` (required)
- `Receipts.PaymentCode` → `Payments.id` (**BIGINT**, not the text `PaymentCode`)
- `Receipts.ProjectCode` → `Projects.ProjectCode` (text, not id)
- `Invoices.ProjectCode` → `Projects.ProjectCode` (text, not id)

## API Endpoints

All endpoints return JSON. Base URL: `http://localhost:5000`

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/suppliers` | List all suppliers |
| GET | `/api/donors` | List all donors |
| GET | `/api/decisions` | List all decisions |
| GET | `/api/projects` | List projects with SupplierName joined |
| GET | `/api/payments` | List payments with joined names + DaysToClose |
| GET | `/api/receipts` | List receipts; raw `PaymentCode` FK untouched, joined text code exposed separately as `paymentCodeDisplay` |
| GET | `/api/invoices` | List invoices with joined names |
| POST | `/api/{table}` | Create record |
| PUT | `/api/{table}/{id}` | Update record |
| DELETE | `/api/{table}/{id}` | Delete record |
| GET | `/api/compliance_report` | Wide compliance view, one row per payment (Phase 4) |
| PUT | `/api/requirements` | Upsert one human-edited compliance slot (Phase 4) |

Allowed tables for DELETE: `Donors, Suppliers, Decisions, Projects, Payments, Receipts, Invoices`
The DELETE route applies `.capitalize()` to the table name from the URL.

## Authentication (added 2026-07-19)

Hand-rolled Flask session auth — no Flask-Login, no Supabase Auth (both
consciously deferred; see `project-context.md` §4b).

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/login` | Login page (server-rendered `login.html`) |
| POST | `/login` | Form POST; sets signed session cookie on success |
| POST | `/logout` | Clears session, redirects to `/login` (POST, never GET) |

Mechanics (all in `app.py`, Authentication section):

- **Default-deny `before_request` guard**: every route requires
  `session['user_id']` except allowlisted endpoints (`login`, `static`).
  API paths (`/api/*`) get `401` JSON; page paths redirect to `/login`.
  Adding a new public route = add its *endpoint name* to that allowlist.
- Passwords: `werkzeug.security` `generate_password_hash` /
  `check_password_hash` (constant-time; never compare hashes with `==`).
  `generate_hash.py` produces hashes for manual row creation.
- Unknown usernames are checked against a startup-generated `_DUMMY_HASH`
  so response timing doesn't reveal which usernames exist; login failures
  return one generic message for the same reason.
- Session fixation: `session.clear()` before setting keys on login.
- Cookie config: `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, 8h lifetime.
  `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` commented until HTTPS (VPS day).
- In-process throttle: 5 failures / 15 min per username (dict, resets on
  restart — Flask-Limiter is the production replacement).
- **App refuses to start without `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` in `.env`** — that key
  signs the session cookie; a guessable key = forgeable logins. Generate:
  `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`.
- `flask_cors`/`CORS(app)` **removed**: frontend is same-origin; n8n calls
  server-to-server (CORS never restricted non-browser clients anyway). Open
  CORS + cookie auth would have let any website ride a logged-in session.
- Frontend: `apiFetch()` wrapper in `app.js` redirects to `/login` on any
  `401` (expired/cleared session mid-use).

### VPS-day hardening checklist (deferred while local-only, MANDATORY before internet exposure)

1. `debug=False` + serve via gunicorn behind nginx/caddy (Werkzeug debugger = RCE).
2. HTTPS via the reverse proxy, then enable `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`.
3. Flask-Limiter for real rate limiting (per-IP + per-username, survives restarts).
4. Error-message hygiene: stop returning raw `str(e)` to clients (leaks DB internals);
   log server-side, return generic messages.
5. `innerHTML` XSS fix (Phase 6 — **higher priority now**: with session cookies,
   XSS ⇒ session theft even with HttpOnly protecting the cookie itself, since
   injected JS can just call the API directly).
6. Check which Supabase key `.env` holds (anon vs service_role) and enable RLS —
   Flask auth does NOT protect Supabase's own REST endpoint if the key leaks.
7. `requirements.txt` slimming (already Phase 6; it's a full pip-freeze incl.
   `pywin32`, which breaks Linux installs).
8. Consider CSRF tokens if any endpoint ever accepts form-encoded POSTs
   cross-origin (SameSite=Lax + JSON-only covers the current surface).

## Business Logic

### DaysToClose (Payments)
Calculated in Python on every GET, not stored in DB:
```python
if ClosingDate is set:
    DaysToClose = None
else:
    DaysToClose = 90 - (today - PaymentDate).days
```
Color coding in frontend: green ≥ 30 days, yellow < 30, red < 10.

### Auto-create Receipt on Payment
When a new payment is POSTed, a receipt is automatically created, inheriting
Project / Payment / Date / Amount / Currency from the payment:
```python
# After inserting payment:
payment_id = payment["id"]           # numeric — used as Receipts.PaymentCode FK

supabase.table("Receipts").insert({
    "ProjectCode":         project_code,   # resolved from ProjectId
    "PaymentCode":         payment_id,     # BIGINT FK -> Payments.id
    "PaymentDate":         data.get("PaymentDate"),
    "Amount":              data.get("Amount"),
    "Currency":            data.get("Currency"),
    "Status":              "Missing",      # never auto-mark a receipt collected
    "RequiresTranslation": True,           # matches DB default (added 2026-07-19)
}).execute()
```
**Bug fixed 2026-07-19:** this insert previously wrote `payment_code` (the TEXT
`PaymentCode`) into the BIGINT FK column — it threw a type error the moment a
payment carried any non-numeric PaymentCode, leaving the payment saved but the
auto-receipt un-created. It now uses the numeric `payment_id`. The receipt does
NOT store the text code anywhere; `get_receipts` resolves it live via the FK join.

### Auto-create Invoice on Project
When a new project is POSTed, an invoice is auto-created for it (invoices are
project-grain), inheriting `ProjectCode` / `SupplierId` / `Currency`; `Status='Missing'`
(under-claim), `RequiresTranslation=True`. Amount is left blank for the officer to fill.
Mirrors the auto-create-receipt-on-payment pattern.

### DriveFolderLink (Projects)
Stored as plain text URL. Rendered as a clickable folder icon in the table.

---

## Frontend Architecture (app.js)

### Global State
```javascript
let currentTable = 'payments';  // active tab
let currentData = [];           // data currently displayed
let editingId = null;           // null = add mode, number = edit mode
let lookupData = { suppliers, donors, projects, decisions, payments };
let columnOrders = {};          // persisted in localStorage
```

### tableConfigs
Each table has:
- `columns`: ordered list of fields to show in the table
- `displayNames`: human-readable column headers
- `formFields`: field definitions for the add/edit modal

**Do not assume `columns`, `formFields`, and the backend's insert/update dict
agree with each other.** All three need independent verification — see
Known Gotchas #7 and #8 for two real cases where they didn't.

### Lookup types in formFields
- `lookup: 'suppliers'` → uses `item.id` as value, `item.CompanyName` as label
- `lookup: 'donors'` → uses `item.id` as value, `item.DonorName` as label
- `lookup: 'projects'` → uses `item.id` as value, `ProjectCode - Subject` as label
- `lookup: 'projectsByCode'` → uses `item.ProjectCode` as value (for Receipts/Invoices FK)
- `lookup: 'decisions'` → uses `item.id` as value, `item.DecisionNumber` as label
- `lookup: 'payments'` → uses `item.id` as value, `PaymentCode — Amount Currency` as label

### Column order
Stored per-table in `localStorage` under key `columnOrders`.
If a ghost column appears (e.g. from old data), clear localStorage to reset.

## Branding & Design (personalize per deployment)

This is the only section of this file that should differ between client
deployments. Replace the placeholders below when setting up for a specific
client, then this note can be deleted for that deployment's copy.

| Setting | Placeholder | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Primary/accent color | `<ACCENT_COLOR>` | hex value matching client brand |
| Logo | `<LOGO_URL>` | hosted image URL or local asset path |
| Organization name | `<ORG_NAME>` | shown in header/title |
| Theme | dark background, accent highlights | swap to light theme if requested |
| Fonts | `<HEADER_FONT>` / `<BODY_FONT>` | defaults used so far: Syne / Space Mono |

## Known Gotchas

1. **Supabase sequence desync** — if you get `duplicate key violates unique constraint` on insert, run:
   ```sql
   SELECT setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('"TableName"', 'id'), (SELECT MAX(id) FROM "TableName"));
   ```
   Run for all tables after any manual data import.

2. **Case-sensitive table names** — always quote table names in SQL: `"Payments"` not `payments`.

3. **Projects has no DonorId** — do not attempt to join Donors from Projects queries.

4. **Receipts.PaymentCode is BIGINT** — always pass `Payments.id` (integer), never the text `PaymentCode`.

5. **DELETE route uses `.capitalize()`** — URL table names are auto-capitalized, so `/api/payments/1` maps to `"Payments"`.

6. **localStorage column orders** — if wrong columns appear in the UI, clear `columnOrders` from localStorage and hard refresh.

7. **RESOLVED 2026-07-19 — `Fatura` (Invoices) / `Makbuz` (Receipts) dropped.** These were real DB columns the backend never wrote (the frontend offered a dropdown, but the four Invoice/Receipt endpoints built an explicit field list that omitted them, silently discarding any value). Both columns are now dropped from the DB and both form fields removed from `tableConfigs`. Kept for history.

8. **RESOLVED 2026-07-19 — `Payments.ReceiptCode` dropped.** It used to silently null on every `update_payment()` save (the form had dropped the field, but the backend still wrote `data.get("ReceiptCode")` → `None`). The column is now dropped and the key removed from `update_payment()`. **`Receipts.ReceiptCode` is a different, unrelated column on another table and stays** — it holds the receipt document's own code (that column is NOT the payment's text code; the earlier "stores the text PaymentCode" description was wrong). Kept for history.

9. **PARTLY RESOLVED 2026-07-19 — badge classes added.** `style.css` now has classes for the six-stage enum (`Missing/Requested/Received/Translated/Sent/Done`) plus `On-Hold` (Projects) and `Return-Closed` (Payments). Remaining cleanup (harmless): dead classes with no matching value anywhere — `status-pending`, `status-approved`, `status-rejected`, `status-paid`, `status-verified`, `status-suspended` — still present, worth pruning in Phase 6.

10. **RESOLVED 2026-07-19 — auto-create receipt FK bug.** `create_payment()`'s auto-receipt wrote the TEXT `PaymentCode` into the BIGINT `Receipts.PaymentCode` FK (would error on any non-numeric PaymentCode, leaving the payment saved but no receipt). Now writes the numeric `payment_id`. See Business Logic → Auto-create Receipt on Payment.

11. **Shared Supabase client is not concurrency-safe (mitigated, not fixed).** The single global `supabase` client (`app.py`) is shared across Flask's dev-server threads; concurrent requests collide on its socket → `500 [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable` (EAGAIN). Surfaced when the UI fired 5 lookup fetches via `Promise.all`. **Mitigated 2026-07-19** by loading those lookups sequentially in `loadLookupData` — but that only removes the UI's own burst. The real fix (per-request / thread-local client, or a serialized server) is a **Phase 5** task, when n8n hits the API concurrently with the UI.

12. **OPEN, PRIORITY before populating real data (found 2026-07-24) — editing `Projects.ProjectCode` (or `Payments.PaymentCode`) breaks once children exist.** `Invoices.ProjectCode` and `Receipts.ProjectCode` are text FKs into `Projects(ProjectCode)` (`agent.md:191`, `:159`); neither constraint declares `ON UPDATE CASCADE`, so Postgres's default `NO ACTION` applies. The moment any Invoice/Receipt row references a given `ProjectCode`, `update_project()` (`app.py:448`) trying to change that same row's `ProjectCode` gets rejected by Postgres with a raw foreign-key-violation error — which `except Exception as e: return jsonify({"success": False, "error": str(e)})` (`app.py:460-461`) ships straight to the browser, unexplained. Same shape of risk on the `Payments.PaymentCode` side if it's ever made an FK target. Fix options: add `ON UPDATE CASCADE` to both FK constraints (lets the code propagate automatically), or make `ProjectCode`/`PaymentCode` immutable after creation (drop them from the `update_*` write dicts) and require a delete+recreate instead. Needs a decision before real data goes in, since a live typo-fix on an in-use `ProjectCode` would hit this right away.

13. **RESOLVED 2026-07-25 — `Receipts.PaymentCode` key collision nulled the Receipt↔Payment link on every edit.** `get_receipts()` used to overwrite the raw numeric `Receipts.PaymentCode` FK with the joined `Payments.PaymentCode` text under the same JSON key before responding. The edit form's `<select>` (`lookup: 'payments'`, options keyed by numeric `item.id` — see Frontend Architecture → Lookup types) could never match a text value against those options, so it silently fell back to the blank placeholder and saved `PaymentCode: null` on every edit unless a specialist manually reselected the payment — breaking the FK, and with it `receipt_compliance`'s join, on any receipt that got edited. Fixed by splitting the key: `get_receipts()` now leaves the raw `PaymentCode` FK untouched in the response and adds a separate `paymentCodeDisplay` key carrying the joined text code; Receipts' `columns`/`displayNames` show `paymentCodeDisplay`, while `formFields` still binds the edit `<select>` to the raw `PaymentCode`.

14. **RESOLVED 2026-07-25 — `viewDetails()` leaked raw/unmapped keys on the "More Details" page.** `viewDetails()` (`app.js`) built its field list from `Object.keys(record)` — the *entire* raw API response — instead of a curated list, so any backend key with no `displayNames` entry rendered with an ugly raw-key fallback label. This was invisible for `Receipts.PaymentCode` specifically only because gotcha #13's bug always overwrote that key before serialization; fixing #13 correctly re-exposed the raw FK, which then leaked into "More Details" as a second, wrongly-labeled `PAYMENTCODE` row next to the correct `paymentCodeDisplay` row. Same flaw affects any table with a raw FK id missing from `displayNames` — confirmed also present for Invoices' `SupplierId`/`DonorId`, a pre-existing leak unrelated to #13 that was fixed by the same change. Fixed by sourcing `viewDetails()`'s field list from `getColumnOrder(currentTable)` — the same source `renderTable()` already uses — so the Details view always mirrors exactly what the table shows, never the raw API payload.
